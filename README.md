Flight Dela analysis
# ‚úàÔ∏è Flight Delay Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing **flight delay patterns** using a dataset of commercial flights. The goal is to identify key reasons for delays, trends across time and geography, and performance metrics of different airlines and airports. Tools used include **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Identify major causes of flight delays (e.g., weather, airline, air traffic).
- Analyze delay trends over time (by month, day, and hour).
- Compare performance across **airlines** and **airports**.
- Provide actionable recommendations to reduce delays.
